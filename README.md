# Anexinet C#/.NET Technical Test

This repository was created to storage the exercises that belong to the Anexinet C#/.NET technical challenge. 



## Getting Started

At this moment you should know what kind of project it is, but please continue reading I'll let you know what are the prerequisites to get a copy of my project on your local machine and how you can run it.


### Prerequisites

About software

```
Install Visual Studio 2017
Install Git
```
Once you have installed the previous software, please clone my repo to your local machine. 

## Running the project

All projects have the same structure, the Program class and another class that performs the algorithm as it is, so to execute the project you just need to run the "Program" class. 

## Running the tests

To run the test is similar to run the application, with a difference that we need to open our "Test Explorer" view, please make sure that you have it opened and then follow the next instructions:

**Tests for the first part of the challenge**
1. Open the "Tests" project.
2. Select the unique class there. Notice that in this class we have some test methods, and each of them has "Arrange, Act and Assert" sections. 
3. In the Test Explorer, we can do a right-click over the "Tests" project and select "Run the selected Tests".
4. Wait until the Unit Tests run to see the Test results, all of them should be passed.
